# Overview

CringeIn is a satirical web application that analyzes LinkedIn posts for "cringe level" - a humorous metric based on common corporate social media patterns. The app allows users to paste LinkedIn posts, receive a cringe score (0-100%), view detected cringe patterns, and get a "decringed" version of their post. Built as a single-page application with a focus on entertainment and social commentary around professional networking culture.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state, React Context for theme and app settings
- **Design System**: Custom design tokens with support for light/dark themes, LinkedIn-inspired color palette (navy blue primary, red-orange for high cringe, green for low cringe)

## Backend Architecture
